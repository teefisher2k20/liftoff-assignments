## Submission Instructions

### Overview

We live in a virtual world and COVID-19 has reshaped how we traditionally do things in our everyday lives. Banks have
evolved into online banking, our favorite restaurants deliver to our homes (via GrubHub, Uber Eats etc.). Just about
anything we desire can be ordered and delivered to us from the Amazon app within 24 hours, doctors have even caught on
to this new wave of convenience by doing appointments via Zoom. The way we cast our votes have yet to follow this trend,
to tackle this issue I'm creating a secure and remote prototype to register potential voters for future elections. It'll
give registered voters the option to vote in the mock election stored in the SQL database.

### Features

Registration: Users will be able to create accounts. Login: Users will be able to log in to the application. Manage
Voters: will have options for making user information updates)
Submit vote: Voters will be able to submit a vote for a list of mock candidate. Manage Candidates: Admin will be able to
add and delete candidates. Election Results: Will show results of election. Polling Locations: Api for polling locations
in the area.

### Technologies

SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, SQL, BootStrap, CSS, Java, API, Hibernate

### What I'll Have to Learn

How to add an API
