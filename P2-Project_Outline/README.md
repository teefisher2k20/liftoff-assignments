## Submission Instructions

### Overview

We live in a virtual world and COVID-19 has reshaped how we traditionally do things in our everyday lives. Banks have
evolved into online banking, our favorite restaurants deliver to our homes (via GrubHub, Uber Eats etc.). Just about
anything we desire can be ordered and delivered to us from the Amazon app within 24 hours, doctors have even caught on
to this new wave of convenience by doing appointments via Zoom. I'm creating a secure and remote prototype to register
customers for future events. It'll store information in the SQL database.

### Features

Registration: Users will be able to create accounts. User: Will have options for making user information updates.
Delete: User will be able to delete customers.

### Technologies

SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, SQL, Java, Hibernate

### What I'll Have to Learn
