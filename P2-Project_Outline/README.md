## Submission Instructions

### Overview

We live in a virtual world and COVID-19 has reshaped how we traditionally do things in our everyday lives. Banks have
evolved into online banking, our favorite restaurants deliver to our homes (via GrubHub, Uber Eats etc..). Just about
anything we desire can be ordered and delivered to us from the Amazon app within 24 hours, doctors have even caught on
to this new wave of convenience by doing appointments via Zoom. The way we cast our votes have yet to follow this trend,
to tackle this issue i'm creating a secure and remote prototype to register potential voters for future elections. It'll
give registered voters the option to vote in the mock election stored in the SQL database.
